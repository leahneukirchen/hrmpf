Welcome to the hrmpf rescue system, built on Void Linux.
There are two accounts:

	- root:voidlinux
	- anon:voidlinux

The `anon` user additionally has `sudo(8)` permissions to run any command
without a password.

You can also use this disk to install Void:

    # void-installer

and follow the on-screen instructions.  To install additional software make
sure to configure your network interface and then use:

	- xbps-install(8) to install/update packages
	- xbps-query(8) to query for package info
	- xbps-reconfigure -a to build ZFS modules

Enjoy!
